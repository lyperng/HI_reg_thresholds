# HI_reg_thresholds
Data and scripts for manuscript: 'Identifying social thresholds and ranking social outcomes: A multi-decadal assessment of Hawaiian social-ecological systems' (Perng et. al, 2023, Marine Policy)

Analyses and plots for the threshold analyses are in 'HI_Thresholds_Analyses_2022.R' and analyses and plots for the outcome ranking (DEA) portion are in 'HI_DEA.R.'
To run the threshold analysis script, 'FUNCTION_gamfit with trends and thresholds.R' must first be run so that the gam_tnt function is in your environment.

Some of the data were preprocessed and the cleaned data files are used in the analyses. Sources for the raw datasets are in Table 1.
